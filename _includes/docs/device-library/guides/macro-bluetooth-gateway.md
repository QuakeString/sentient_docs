[Macro Bluetooth Gateway]({{deviceVendorLink}}){:target="_blank"} is designed based on LoRaWAN and Bluetooth 5.0 technology. It receives nearby [beacon](https://www.lansitec.com/products/bluetooth-beacon/){:target="_blank"} information and forwards it to a LoRaWAN gateway.<br>
It is powered by 38,000mAh industrial battery with a standby time as long as 7 years.<br>

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide we will need the following:
