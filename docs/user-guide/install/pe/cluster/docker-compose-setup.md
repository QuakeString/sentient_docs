This guide will help you to setup SENTIENT in cluster mode with Docker Compose. 
For this purpose, we will use docker container images available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=sentient&type=image&image_filter=store).

## Prerequisites

SENTIENT Microservices are running in dockerized environment.
Before starting please make sure Docker Engine and Docker Compose are installed in your system. 

{% include templates/install/docker-install.md %}

{% capture rule_engine_note %}
Please note that for the deployment of Rule Engine as a separate service, an additional separate License Key is required. 
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=rule_engine_note %}

{% include templates/install/docker-install-note.md %}

## Step 1. Pull SENTIENT Professional Edition Images

{% include templates/install/dockerhub/pull.md %}

## Step 2. Clone SENTIENT Professional Edition Docker Compose scripts

```bash
git clone -b release-{{ site.release.ce_ver }} https://github.com/sentient/sentient-pe-docker-compose.git tb-pe-docker-compose --depth 1
cd tb-pe-docker-compose
```
{: .copy-code}

## Step 3. Obtain your license key

We assume you have already chosen your subscription plan or decided to purchase a perpetual license. 
If not, please navigate to [pricing](/pricing/) page to select the best license option for your case and get your license. 
See [How-to get pay-as-you-go subscription](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK-QDFGxWek){:target="_blank"} or [How-to get perpetual license](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPe0lHolWek){:target="_blank"} for more details.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** if you decide to use an [advanced deployment type](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/cluster/docker-compose-setup/#step-6-configure-deployment-type), make sure you have purchased a license key for at least four instances of SENTIENT Professional Edition. 
Otherwise, you need to modify the local copy of [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/sentient/sentient-pe-docker-compose/blob/master/advanced/docker-compose.yml)) 
to use the number of SENTIENT instances that you've purchased.
We will reference the license key you have obtained during this step as PUT_YOUR_LICENSE_SECRET_HERE later in this guide.


## Step 4. Configure your license key

```bash
nano tb-node.env
```
{: .copy-code}

and put the license secret parameter instead of "PUT_YOUR_LICENSE_SECRET_HERE":

```bash
# SENTIENT server configuration
...
TB_LICENSE_SECRET=PUT_YOUR_LICENSE_SECRET_HERE
```

## Step 5. Configure deployment type

Starting SENTIENT v2.2, it is possible to install SENTIENT cluster using new microservices architecture and docker containers. 
See [**microservices**](/docs/reference/msa/) architecture page for more details.

The docker compose scripts support three deployment modes. In order to set the deployment mode, change the value of `TB_SETUP` variable in `.env` file to one of the following:

- `basic` **(recommended, set by default)** - SENTIENT Core and Rule Engine are launched inside one JVM (requires only one license).
  MQTT, CoAP and HTTP transports are launched in separate containers.
- `monolith` - SENTIENT Core and Rule Engine are launched inside one JVM (requires only one license). 
  MQTT, CoAP and HTTP transports are also launched in the same JVM to minimize memory footprint and server requirements.
- `advanced`- SENTIENT Core and Rule Engine are launched in separate containers and are replicated one JVM (requires 4 licenses).  
  
All deployment modes support separate JS executors, Redis, and different [queues](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/cluster/docker-compose-setup/#step-8-choose-sentient-queue-service).

## Step 6. Configure SENTIENT database

{% include templates/install/configure-db-docker-compose.md %}

## Step 7. Choose SENTIENT queue service 

{% include templates/install/install-queue-docker-compose.md %}

{% capture contenttogglespecqueue %}
Kafka <small>(default, recommended for on-prem, production installations)</small>%,%kafka%,%templates/install/cluster-queue-kafka.md%br%
Confluent Cloud <small>(Event Streaming Platform based on Kafka)</small>%,%confluent-cloud%,%templates/install/cluster-queue-confluent-cloud.md{% endcapture %}
{% include content-toggle.liquid content-toggle-id="ubuntuSentientQueue" toggle-spec=contenttogglespecqueue %}

## Step 8. Enable monitoring (optional)

{% include templates/install/configure-monitoring-docker-compose.md %}

## Step 9. Enable SENTIENT ANALYTICS (optional)

You may optionally install SENTIENT ANALYTICS any time using the following steps:

Edit the configuration file:

```bash
nano .env
```
{: .copy-code}

You'll need to make sure that `TRENDZ_ENABLED` variable set to `true`:

```bash
TRENDZ_ENABLED=true
```

You can read about SENTIENT ANALYTICS [here](/docs/sentient-analytics/what-is-sentient-analytics/).

## Step 10. Running

### Create and check required host volumes
{% include templates/install/docker/docker-compose-setup-volumes.md %}

### Install and run SENTIENT
{% assign dockerComposeFileLocation = "-f $TB_SETUP/docker-compose.yml " %}
{% include templates/install/docker/docker-compose-setup-running.md %}

## Post-installation steps

{% include templates/install/generate_certificate_docker-compose.md %}

### Upgrading to new SENTIENT version

{% include templates/install/upgrade-sentient.md %}

### Upgrading to new SENTIENT ANALYTICS version (Optional)

SENTIENT ANALYTICS have different version system, and should be updated separately from SENTIENT platform main services.

To update SENTIENT ANALYTICS, it's necessary to edit .env file to set "TRENDZ_VERSION" to target version (e.g. set it to {{ site.release.sentient-analytics_ver }} if you are upgrading to the latest). Then, execute the following commands:

```bash
./docker-stop-services.sh
./docker-upgrade-sentient-analytics.sh
./docker-start-services.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

Note that you can upgrade SENTIENT ANALYTICS from any version to the latest (for example, 1.12.0 -> {{ site.release.sentient-analytics_ver }} etc).
